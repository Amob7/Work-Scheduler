# Work Scheduler

## Description

This program was made to set up a schedule for anyone to use. The program intends to show the day at the top and be ordered from 9 to 5. There is a save button on the right side so you can save your schedule to local storage and come back to the list later.

If the time of day is past the time on the schedule, than that section of the scheduler will be grayed out. If the time of day exceeds the time on the scheduler, than that section will be green. Lastly if the time of day is at the hour of the scheduler, than that section will be red.

This program helped me become more comfortable with moment, dom traversal, and even jquerys.
